=head1 NAME

RT-Extension-ActivityReports - Additional reports to show Activity in RT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ActivityReports extension lets you see:

    * activity detail - a table of ticket status per queue, and totals

    * activity summary - a one-line summary of all updates made

    * resolution comments - summary of when tickets were resolved, duration
      between creation and (latest) resolution

    * resolution statistics - for each queue, average duration between
      creation and (latest) resolution over the last 30, 60, 90 days, and all time

    * time worked statistics - for each user, a table of every queue and how
      long that user has worked on tickets that have been resolved in a
      particular timeframe. for example, you can see how much time Joe has
      spent on Basic Support (queue) tickets that have been resolved the day
      after they were created

All of these reports can be filtered by actor, arbitrary search query,
and/or between two dates, so it's quite flexible.
