NAME
    RT-Extension-ActivityReports - Additional reports to show Activity in RT

DESCRIPTION
    The ActivityReports extension lets you see:

        * activity detail - a table of ticket status per queue, and totals

        * activity summary - a one-line summary of all updates made

        * resolution comments - summary of when tickets were resolved, duration
          between creation and (latest) resolution

        * resolution statistics - for each queue, average duration between
          creation and (latest) resolution over the last 30, 60, 90 days, and all time

        * time worked statistics - for each user, a table of every queue and how
          long that user has worked on tickets that have been resolved in a
          particular timeframe. for example, you can see how much time Joe has
          spent on Basic Support (queue) tickets that have been resolved the day
          after they were created

    All of these reports can be filtered by actor, arbitrary search query,
    and/or between two dates, so it's quite flexible.
